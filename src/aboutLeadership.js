        description: "I’m a mom of three adorable kids, one snuggly Bernedoodle named Casey (courtesy of PuppySpot), and am married to a great guy. I grew up in Michigan (go Blue!) and our family always desired to have puppies…but I was allergic. My family waited until I left for college to bring “Bart the Wonder Dog (Welsh Corgi)” home. He immediately stole our hearts. My professional path has focused on leading teams or companies in service first industries, with my most recent pre-PuppySpot job running Sales Strategy & Operations for HomeAdvisor (now known as Angi). I joined the PuppySpot team as head of Revenue Operations in 2019 because I believe puppies positively impact peoples’ lives. Casey joined our family in 2020, by then I knew there was no better place to find our perfect puppy. I was promoted to CEO in 2021, a role I am thrilled to play. My family and I now live happily in central New Jersey."

        description: "Vice PI am relatively new to the PuppySpot team, having served as Director of Analytics for Digital Fuel Capital and before that as Senior Data Scientist at Care.com and an Economic Analyst at the Economic Development Research Group. As you can no doubt infer, data is my thing. But so is playing with my kids, and sneaking in a long run here and there. Our family members include two guinea pigs, Charlotte and Poppy. The kids are pressing hard for a puppy, which means we’re going to become a PuppySpot customer very soon."

        title: "Vice President, Product and Technology, aka the CXpert",
        description: "Hello from Chicago where my soon to be husband and I live. I am sort of a newbie at PuppySpot, since most of our team members have been with us for a long time, because who wouldn’t want to work with puppies? I joined in May 2023 as Vice President of Product and Technology which means I am here to make sure we deliver an amazing customer experience on the PuppySpot website and do it all as efficiently as possible. My team is also amazing, we love what we do. Before coming to PuppySpot, I held different roles at Ruggable, Home Chef, and Nielsen. I learned firsthand that great companies are great at customer experience, and so that’s what we are after here. I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Cleveland Browns, and many other things. When I have a free moment, I like digging in the dirt in my garden, making delicious meals with friends, and hitting the road to explore the wonders of the world. "

        title: "Vice President, Marketplace Operations aka the Coach",
        description: "I joined the amazing SarahPuppy team in January 2023 to work with our national network of certified breeder partners on how together we can continue to provide perfect puppies to our customers in the most perfect way. It’s been a blast thus far; all great people doing a really important job: delivering unconditional love. Prior to PuppySpot I ran operations for a company called Palmetto and before that had a long stint at GrubHub, where I ended up as Senior Director, Merchant Strategy and Operations. Geographically, I have been a bit of a pinball."

        title: "Director, People & Recruiting aka the Perfect Puppy People Officer",
        description: "Some people call me a Jersey girl, because, well, I did in fact grow up in New Jersey. I spent 12 zany years in Manhattan and now live in bucolic Saddle River with my partner Joe, our beautiful and bright red-headed daughter Zoey, and Jagger, our Boston Terrier. I joined PuppySpot in 2019 after almost a decade as an Executive Recruiter for JSB Partners, boutique executive recruiting firm. Think Hedge Funds, Private Equity, and Investment Bank. I ended up being promoted to Vice President Executive Recruiter. As much as I appreciated the recognition I came to realize that I wanted more. I wanted to really love my job. And that’s what led me to PuppySpot. I started out as the Recruiting Manager and was promoted to Director of People and Recruiting. My job is to help deliver on our promise of being “The Perfect Puppy People” by making sure we hire and retain team members with the empathy and expertise to deliver perfect puppies perfectly. I’m a devout animal lover, an avid kickboxer, and a fanatical kayaker, with Zoey, Jagger and Joe always in tow!."
